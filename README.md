# docker-kdesrc-build

This project aims to provide a lightweight and ready to use KDE development
environment by wrapping the `kdesrc-build` tool in Docker.

This way, you can compile and work on the latest version of the KDE project 
and keep your main system clean of unwanted development packages.

You can run a KDE application on your current desktop by sharing your X
server instance inside the Docker container

Moreover, you can run and try the entire Plasma Desktop in another tty !

# Requirements

- `python` `>=` `3.2`
- `docopt`
- `docker`

# Usage

## Quick and simple

Just choose a distro as a base system for the container (`archlinux` 
is recommended, as it has the latest dependencies), and run the script :

    ./run.py --base archlinux

The script will do the following operations :

* check for a `Dockerfile-archlinux` file
* create a dir under `$HOME/kdebuild/archlinux` to be mounted under `/work`
* build or update the Docker image `archlinux-kdedev` if necessary
* mount `bash_profile` as a volume (`/home/kdedev/.bash_profile`)
* mount `kdesrc-buildrc` as a volume (`/home/kdedev/.kdesrc-buildrc`)
* run the container
* pull the latest version of `kdesrc-build`
* run `kdesrc-build`

You can pass arguments `kdesrc-build` script with the following syntax :

    ./run.py --base archlinux -- --arg1 --arg2 ...

## I want a shell

Just use the `--shell` option. Instead of invoking `kdesrc-build`, it will
run `/bin/bash` so you can work and try whatever you want in the environement.

    ./run.py --base archlinux --shell

## Use a specific version of Qt
--------------------------------

If you want to change the Qt version used during the compilation, you can
provide a the path to a Qt installation on the host with :

    ./run.py --base archlinux --qt /path/to/qt

This path will be mounted under `/qt`

Don't forget to change the `qtdir` variable in the `kdesrc-buildrc`

## Command line options reference

    Usage: build.py [options] [--shell | -- [<kdesrc-build-args>...]]
